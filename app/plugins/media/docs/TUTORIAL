TUTORIAL
========
This is a very basic tutorial which walks you through most of the 
components of the plugin. For more information see the documentation
within the docs directory or read the API documentation of the classes.

Preparation Work
----------------
First switch to your application directory. 
$ cd /path/to/app

Now let's get us a fresh copy of the plugin and directly clone it into the
application's plugins directory.
$ git clone git://github.com/davidpersson/media.git plugins/media

Now we go and load the configuration that comes with the plugin. Edit
your app's config/core.php and add the following code.
{{{
    require APP . '/plugins/media/config/core.php';
}}}

In order to initialize the directories for storing i.e. uploaded files
we use the shell which comes with the plugin. You can also do this 
manually of course.
$ cake/console/cake media init

Some directories must be writable so that the webserver (assuming it
runs under a different user) can store files in there.
$ chmod âˆ’R a+rwX webroot/media/{transfer,filter} 

Expanding on the blog tutorial we add the following fields to our 
posts table: dirname, basename. This will allow us to associate 
a file with each post we do.

Uploading
---------
We now go and change a few things in order to allow for uploading
files via the form. Modify the template in views/posts/add and change
the form create statement by specifying type file as well as adding
an input for the file to be uploaded.
{{{
echo $form->create('Post', array('type' => 'file));
...
echo $form->input('file', array('type' => 'file'));
...
}}}

When you now go and inspect $this->data within in your Posts controller's
add action, you should see something like this after you tried 
uploading a file. The file gets submitted but will discarded as it's
currently not handled by any code.
{{{
Array 
( 
	[Post] => Array 
	( 
	[title] => Demo 
	[file] => Array 
		( 
			[name] => clipboard.jpg 
			[type] => image/jpeg 
			[tmp_name] => /private/var/tmp/php4zN7BY 
			[error] => 0 
			[size] => 32405 
		) 
	) 
) 
}}}

Until now nearly everything you did wasn't really taking advantage of
the plugin. We'll change that now by editing the post model in 
models/posts.php by adding the transfer behavior to the actsAs property.
{{{
class Post extends AppModel {
	var $actsAs = array('Media.Transfer');
}
}}}

If you now go and repeat submitting the file via the add form, this
time the file should end up being stored below webroot/media/transfer
in img/clipboard.jpg.

Coupling
--------
In order associate the file with the new post record (in this case titled Demo) 
we add another behavior from the plugin to the mix.
{{{
class Post extends AppModel {
	var $actsAs = array('Media.Transfer', 'Media.Coupler');
}
}}}
 
Repeating the upload now will not only store the file in the transfer 
directory but additionally store it's dirname and basename within
the new record which should look something like this.
{{{
$result = $this->Post->findById($this->Post->getLastInsertID()); 
var_dump($result);

Array 
( 
    [Post] => Array 
    ( 
      [id] => 1
      [title] => Demo 
      [dirname] => img
      [basename] => clipboard.jpg
    ) 
) 
}}}

If you want to get fancy, make use of the virtual fields feature
in CakePHP 1.3 by adding the following field definition to you model.
{{{
var $virtualFields = array(
    'path' => "CONCAT_WS('/', dirname, basename)"
);
}}}

Filtering Uploaded Files
------------------------
Most of this should Just Work(TM) as it is expected that you have a pretty
default setup. Have a look at the plugin's config/core.php file on more options
to configure the Media_Process class which is used by the following behavior
class if something doesn't work the way expected here.

In order to generate versions from the uploaded file we add the generator 
behavior to the mix.
{{{
class Post extends AppModel {
	var $actsAs = array('Media.Transfer', 'Media.Generator', 'Media.Coupler');
}
}}}

As the generator behavior will make versions of the uploaded file according to
configuration, we open up the plugin's config/core.php to have a look on the
defaults.
{{{
...
$s = array('convert' => 'image/png', 'zoomCrop' => array(100, 100));
$m = array('convert' => 'image/png', 'fitCrop' => array(300, 300));
$l = array('convert' => 'image/png', 'fit' => array(600, 440));

Configure::write('Media.filter', array(
    ...
	'image' => compact('s', 'm', 'l')
    ...
));
...
}}}

This set of configurations is called instructions. Basically these are methods
which get called on the Media_Process_* class. However the defaults should work
fine for us. Keep in mind that if you'd like to change the defaults you should
do so in your app's config/core.php right after the statement where you load
the plugin's configuration.

Repeat uploading the file as you did in prior steps. This time - assuming 
you've been uploading an image file - you should see the following files 
being generated.

webroot/media/transfer/img/test.jpg
webroot/media/filter/s/img/test.jpg
webroot/media/filter/m/img/test.jpg
webroot/media/filter/l/img/test.jpg

Protecting the transfer directory
---------------------------------
Currently your transfer directory is open to the public, which means 
user's can access any files they uploaded there. If you can't trust
the user's being able to upload stuff you better go with the following
steps:

 - Relocate the transfer directory. In your app's config/core.php add
   following code right above the statement where you load the plugin
   configuration.
   {{{
   define('MEDIA_TRANSFER', APP . 'transfer' . DS);
   define('MEDIA_TRANSFER_URL', false);
   }}}

   After that reinitialize the directories.
   $ cake/console/cake media init

 - Block requests through the webserver's configuration. In your app's
   config/core.php add following code right above the statement where you load
   the plugin configuration.
   {{{   
   define('MEDIA_TRANSFER_URL', false);
   }}}

   After that protect the directories.
   $ cake/console/cake media protect
   
 - Reimplement a special method in models/post.php used by the transfer 
   behavior in order to make it use non-guessable file names.
   {{{
	function transferTo($via, $from) {
		extract($from);

		$irregular = array(
			'image' => 'img',
			'text' => 'txt'
		);
		$name = Mime_Type::guessName($mimeType ? $mimeType : $file);

		if (isset($irregular[$name])) {
			$short = $irregular[$name];
		} else {
			$short = substr($name, 0, 3);
		}

		$path  = $short . DS;
		$path .= uniqid(); // <--- This is the important part.
		$path .= !empty($extension) ? '.' . strtolower($extension) : null;

		return $path;
	}
   }}}
   
Validate incoming transfers
---------------------------
You should always validate incoming transfers for following reasons.

 1. Check that there's actually been an upload.
 2. Avoid overwhelming your server (too many pixels, too many megabytes).
 3. The uploaded file has the correct type (real MIME-type sniffed from contents, extension).
 4. The file's origin is correct (i.e. it is stored in the tmp directory).

Here we add a bunch of validation rules to the post model. Please read up on 
the transfer behavior's documentation for information about the rules.

{{{
...
	var $validate = array(
		'file' => array(
			'resource'   => array('rule' => 'checkResource'),
			'access'     => array('rule' => 'checkAccess'),
			'location'   => array('rule' => array('checkLocation', array(
				MEDIA_TRANSFER, '/tmp/'
			))),
			'permission' => array('rule' => array('checkPermission', '*')),
			'size'       => array('rule' => array('checkSize', '5M')),
			'pixels'     => array('rule' => array('checkPixels', '1600x1600')),
			'extension'  => array('rule' => array('checkExtension', false, array(
				'jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'tif', 'tiff', 'gif', 'pdf', 'tmp'
			))),
			'mimeType'   => array('rule' => array('checkMimeType', false, array(
				'image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/tiff', 'image/gif', 'application/pdf'
	)))));
...
}}}

Be advised that some of these rules may be to strict or cause other trouble so that
in the end you won't be able to upload files.

Deleting Corresponding Files
----------------------------
Deleting works as you'd expect (with one exception). First it is assumed that
there is a 1:1 relationship between files and records. So when deleting a
record, coupled to a file, the Coupler behavior will also go and delete that
file. 

Now that one exception is generated versions derived from the coupled file
*will not* get deleted automatically. For this piece of functionality you'll
need to implement the logic on your own. Following a snippet which does this in
an exemplaric way.  Add it to to the model you've attached Generator and
Coupler behaviors to.

{{{
	public function beforeDelete($cascade = true) {
		if (!$cascade) {
			return true;
		}

		$result = $this->find('first', array(
			'conditions' => array($this->primaryKey => $this->id),
			'fields'	 => array('dirname', 'basename'),
			'recursive'  => -1
		));
		if (empty($result)) {
			return false;
		}

		$pattern  = MEDIA_FILTER . "*/";
		$pattern .= $result[$this->alias]['dirname'] . '/';
		$pattern .= pathinfo($result[$this->alias]['basename'], PATHINFO_FILENAME);

		$files = glob("{$pattern}.*");

		$name = Mime_Type::guessName($result[$this->alias]['basename']);
		$versions = array_keys(Configure::read('Media.filter.' . $name));

		if (count($files) > count($versions)) {
			$message  = 'MediaFile::beforeDelete - ';
			$message .= "Pattern `{$pattern}` matched more than number of versions. ";
			$message .= "Failing deletion of versions and record for `Media@{$this->id}`.";
			CakeLog::write('warning', $message);
			return false;
		}

		foreach ($files as $file) {
			$File = new File($file);

			if (!$File->delete()) {
				return false;
			}
		}
		return true;
	}
}}}

_Reasoning_: Derived versions are not deleted automatically because there are
many different scenarios in which some of them don't allow to create a
relationship between versions and original file. You might know that version
files a1 and a2 belong to original a but not vice versa.  In order to leave
wrong assumptions out (which in case of file deletion might cause data loss!)
the explicit implementation is the most flexible way to do so.
